# Hi there 👋 I am Eduardo Martin Lorenzo
### :computer: A software developer :computer:

I'm a professional web & software developer. I started in 2019 as a web developer, training in front technologies like Angular, and using Spring for backend development.
Later I started training in mobile development, with cross-platform technologies such as React Native and Flutter <img src="https://github.com/EMLCoding/EMLCoding/blob/main/flutter.jpg" width="40" height="40"/>.
I am currently training as an iOS (native) developer with Swift and SwiftUI, and developing my own projects in my spare time
